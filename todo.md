1. when there's 2 missing field of data for example:
   Datos faltantes a completar:
   Póliza 1 (APEF-SC2-000152-00-2025): Prima
   Póliza 1 (APEF-SC2-000152-00-2025): Condiciones específicas (deducibles, coaseguro, etc.)
   the editor mode only accepts fixing the condiciones específicas and its unable to let the user fix the Prima missing value.

2. when a client's letter has been generated succesfully there's no indication on the dashboard, if the user comes back after generating the letter I may generate it again out of confusion, paint in light green the data row that already has been used for generating a letter.

3. letter generation screen doesn't let add the client's information if it is missing

4. generated letters are horrible and not even simmilar to the example letters pdf (fix later).

    - the table headers get all squashed on the left side instead of being correctly distributed through the table
    - the font isn't the same size nor type

5. check if multiple polizas are compiled into a single letter properly
